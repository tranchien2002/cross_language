      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "I recently interviewed for a company who believed in pair programming one hundred percent of the time on all projects. It got me thinking about how pair programming, on this scale, would impact me as a developer and whether it would actually be effective and useful. This blog post will explore and analyse the benefits and costs of pair programming one hundred percent of the time as a software development technique.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Concept\n",
      "\n",
      "Pair programming is an agile software development technique where two developers work together at the same computer. The developer who actively implements the program is known as the driver, while the other is the observer. The observer's role is to continuously monitor the work of the driver to identify syntactic errors, spelling mistakes etc. The observer is also responsible for steering the design of the project in the right direction. Both developers switch roles frequently.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are three possible pairing permutation when pair programming. Novice-novice, novice-expert and expert-expert.\n",
      "\n",
      "The novice-novice pairing variation has shown an increase in productivity in comparison to developers working on their own [3]. The novice-expert variation makes for a great training tool to introduce a new hire to a development language or framework that they are unfamiliar with [5]. The expert-expert is a powerful variation and can lead to a boost in productivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "However with each of these variations,  studies and developers [5] have both shown that pair programming is best for solving new, previously unseen problems. This is indicative that pair programming one hundred percent of the time may not be appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reaping the Benefits\n",
      "\n",
      "The aim of pair programming is to improve code quality and efficiency while simultaneously providing an outlet for developers to learn from each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Studies have shown that even pair programming by two novices is more productive than a solo developer coding on their own [3]. There are also definitive results that clearly show that code quality improves when pair programming is used. It has been shown to reduce defects by up to 15% [1]. Having the code the driver is writing be constantly reviewed by the observer leads, not only, to more errors being caught immediately. It is also more efficient to constantly review the code than to only review upon completion.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the nicest benefits of pair programming is team building.  It encourages better communication and collaboration. Programming is often depicted as a solitary task and developers as shy, quiet people. Pair programming, however, forces developers to actively work together which can lead to more productive teams, not just individuals . Most of the studies referenced below, point this out [1][2][3].\n",
      "\n",
      "However, one key factor that is evident from all these studies is that they don't seem to have considered what pair programming is like if it is being carried out one hundred percent of the time, all day, everyday. While it is true that developers don't code all the day, there are a number of scenarios where pair programming one hundred percent of the time may not be the best course of action.\n",
      "\n",
      "100% Pair Programming: Yea or Nay\n",
      "\n",
      "While empirical studies prove that pair programming is one of the best things to happen in software development, I am not convinced by them. The one factor that they do not seem to take into account a great deal is  the ‘human' factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the name of (short term) productivity\" – Mark Needham [5]\n",
      "\n",
      "The implementation phase of a software project is not all just about overcoming challenges. All projects have mundane and often trivial code that needs to be implemented to carry out the most basic of tasks. The problem is that the observer will just have to observe this dull, trivial  process without being able to contribute anything useful. Their skills could have been put to better use in implementing a critical piece of code, or another piece of trivial code which had yet to be implemented. The approach of pairing one hundred percent of the time can lead to a waste of a developers time and talent. This could slow down the development as there may be many other pieces of code yet to be implemented which could be implemented by the observer. This argument still holds when the developers switch roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pairing all the time is also a terrible way for a developer to learn to use any development tools. Watching the driver make use of various tools, or watching them figure out how to use these tools is not educational. Some tasks need to be completed by the learner themselves to be able to fully understand them. This is similar to a person claiming they can play basketball because they have watched a few games on TV.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to this, there is a time for individual work unhampered by the need when mundane tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't want to waste their time. You don't want to argue (unless the other person wants to as well). You give in more often than if you were working alone.\" – Mark Wilden [6]\n",
      "\n",
      "Pair programming depends on the abilities of two developers to successfully collaborate and work togethe. The studies below all assume that people will get along with each other the entire time. Perhaps this should be the case in a work environment as professionals are expected to put aside their feelings, but realistically that this is simply not the case. This is not implying that they may resent each other (they might), but they may disagree a lot when it comes minor design decisions. This may slow down the pace of implementation and in some cases lead to one developer believing that their opinion is not correct or worth taking into account. This can be quite demoralising, leading to feelings of resentment. This could be prevented if pair programming weren't being carried out constantly and only major design decisions were discussed, leaving the minor decision to the coder's discretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pair programming doesn't encourage quiet reflection and exploration.\" – Mark Wilden [6]\n",
      "\n",
      "As a developer, getting a feel for the language and codebase is quite important when it comes to implementing designs. Just as children learn by trial and error, developers learn by exploring the code. Many innovative ideas can also stem from exploring the codebase; refactoring certain classes for example. However, if a developer never gets enough time to work their way through the code or language then they can never truly get comfortable with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Wilden and Needham, I think pair programming should be used in moderation. In my own limited experience as a developer, I faced days where my productivity was low. It could be argued that on these days pair programming all day would have helped this, but I don't think it would have. Almost everyone who has has some work experience can relate to days where your brain does not seem to want to function properly. The mind doesn't think straight; logic, which was always like second nature is baffling and even words escape you. On these days a developer just wants to get through the day. These unproductive days have always been compensated with extremely productive, slightly longer, working days. However if forced to pair program all day on such days then I'd have to say that it most likely would not have resulted in feelings of hatred, however it may have led me to associate negative feelings with programming with my pairing partner. This is not a failing on the concept of pair programming alone, in fact pair programming in small increments may help, but on human nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pair programming is incredibly beneficial and should be used in moderation especially when used to exchange knowledge. It can make a great coaching tool and when used to solve a new, unseen problem it can help teams work together to design innovative solutions .  However pairing one hundred percent of the time should be approached with caution to ensure that colleagues do not develop mutual feelings of annoyance towards one another.\n",

      "Many would lead you to believe that blockchain tech and banks are like cats and dogs. The statement is not entirely true, even if there are spheres where these sectors might choose different ways. However, blockchain has proven to have applications that financial sector saw as very interesting and its solutions have been already applied in some banks as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, we made this review about the connection that blockchain shares with banks and what is the future of the potential link.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blockchain and Banking — a War?\n",
      "Many crypto enthusiasts thought of blockchain as a complete substitute for banking and middleman in payment systems. Cryptocurrencies, according to many, have the main goal of kicking out banks as intermediaries as it will provide a decentralized peer-to-peer system where fees are low, transfers are fast, and security is top notch.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, banks did see positive implications in implementing blockchain and many do allow their services to be connected with cryptos. Bank transfers and credit cards are available when purchasing bitcoin and altcoins in many exchanges. Apart from payments, blockchain has several advantages that banks can profit from, much like any other business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Connecting Banks and Blockchain\n",
      "Blockchain has functions that improve the efficiency of the financial systems. These have been implemented in various industries with great success, due to their wide-ranged application. In the case of banking, several spheres of blockchain are compatible with financial services, them being a network of information, ledger accounting, and transaction system.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The network that blockchain offers refers to complete communication of vital information among all participants within the system. All transactions and accompanying details find their place within the ledger accounts, available for all parties involved. Each transaction is irreversible, meaning that tempering with data is not possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The transaction system offers a platform where all funds can be evaluated according to a single unit of measurement, independent of all factors. Coins that would come out as a result of blockchain technology can be a worthy substitute of several fiats at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smart contracts would help evolve the decision-making hierarchy, securing the network form fraud and misinformation. In the case of banks, the whole network would connect the business with its customers in a system that would provide speed through smart contracts, low fees through unified cryptocurrency, and accuracy through smart contracts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current Issues\n",
      "\n",
      "Although advantageous, there are reasons why many believe in incompatibility between blockchain and banks. The very first reason lies in the fact that its security is not of the level financial institutions can accept. Many hacking and fraud incidents happened in the past, while development efforts, although existent, are yet to answer the changeless of modern cybercrime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason is the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, while banks keep a strict hierarchy within its doors. The control over the overall market is out of reach for a single entity, while banks work according to the policies set by Central Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the fiat currencies fluctuate at a very low frequency and intensity compared to cryptocurrencies. Coins that are active in the market (and many of them are, in point of fact) experiences drastic changes in value, while banks seek stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without a stable market with the more centralized system, it is hard to expect of any major movement of adoption of the technology, apart from individual efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use Cases of Blockchain in Banks\n",
      "Several banks did implement their own in-house solutions that include blockchain though it is important to stress the work in-house. Apart from Ripple, rare are blockchain systems that have been accepted by financial companies readily, especially those that are completely decentralized in nature. An interesting fact is that mostly Swiss-based banks are the ones that are actively seeking to research blockchain technology, which is why we chose several of them in our analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "UBS — The Swiss-based bank decided to embrace the blockchain technology in 2015, announcing its attention in a white paper. The project was co-financed with IBM, with a name Batavia, where live transactions were conducted with corporate clients. So far, two transactions were made in the meantime, car sales in Germany and textile sales in Austria. Both were cross-border and went through the UBS’s blockchain network.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Credit Suisse — Yet another Swiss bank that explored possibilities with blockchain announced recently its wish to implement the system. Through a partnership with ING, the bank, much like UBS, uses the technology through smart contracts and only for transactions. Yet, its whitepaper stated that in the near future, other features are to be expected, such as complete customer network, and a cryptocurrency within the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Santander Group — The bank was part of the project that involved several other financial institutions and Clearmatics (a London-based blockchain development company). The joint venture tested several transactions using the beta version of the platform between participating banks and is said to go live within the second part of 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "Future Outlook\n",
      "It is evident now that most banks are yet to release blockchain-based platforms into the public. They are at the stage of testing and are only observing the behavior of the network within the tightly-controlled environment. It might take some time until a larger portion of financial institutions trusts the network to the point of complete adoption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, blockchain network is developed in-house, with very little trust given to already-existent cryptocurrencies. Reasons are simple — most of the coins are based on decentralized marketplace and are prone to large changes. Hacking incidents do not help the cause with banks as well, which pushes the management to develop its own technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Swiss banks are pushing the agenda, boosted by the government’s favorable stance of the crypto industry. Thus, we can safely say that the future looks bright for the cooperation between blockchain and banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some Final Thoughts\n",
      "All in all, the banking system has shown interest so far into the blockchain though beta testing is the most we can get of it right now. Thus, patience is needed, especially since most of the institutions choose to create their own systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blockchain has many advantages, ones that banking experts cannot ignore, such as smart contracts, decentralized transactions, and a unified currency. It might take some time until we see the larger application of the tech within the financial sector, but we will get there as seen with case studies in this article.\n",

      "What You Will Learn: [show]\n",
      "\n",
      "What is Communication?\n",
      "Communication is the act of conveying a message to another person through a mutually understandable medium/language.\n",
      "Communication means an exchange of information between two or more people.\n",
      "It is a process of sharing information, ideas, feelings, news and achieving a common understanding between people.\n",
      "Communication connects people.\n",
      "For organizations, communication helps all departments work together.\n",

      "The following diagram says it all:\n",
      "\n",
      "Communication\n",
      "\n",
      "1) No-Verbal Communication: Non-Verbal communication is conveying information using non-word messages such as posture, gestures, facial expressions, eye contact, etc.  It plays a significant role in conversations, meetings or even interviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this is not the topic of discussion for today's article. So, we will move right along to the next category.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Written Communication: It is communication through written symbols. When the verbal and non-verbal modes don't suffice we write things down. This way the information gets recorded as well and is more accurate and formal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Writing skills are very important for Software Testers. We write several status/bug reports and many test artifacts to communicate with various teams – Formally and Informally.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Verbal or Spoken Communication: A way of communication through words (language) or sounds is verbal communication. The easiest way of expressing our thoughts, ideas and feelings are by talking. Hence, it is the simplest and most effective. This could also be formal (a face to face meeting at work OR a telephonic interview OR conference call) and informal (casual coffee room chat with a colleague).\n",

      "QA project\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "#1. Planning:\n",
      "A good plan is like a road map: it shows the final destination and usually the best way to get there.  — H. Stanely Judd\n",
      "\n",
      "A good planner is an achiever. But when it comes to real-time planning, believe me, it's not easy. You have to consider everything – Your strength and your weaknesses, team's capabilities and tools availability, requirements and constraints, approach and obstacles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Planning is not just about documenting details but about understanding and identifying objects and defining clear strategy or approach. Planning, most of the time, is being done at higher level and implemented at every level. Although involving proposed team members in planning can make a huge difference in overall success of the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the time, we struggle to define coverage and exit criteria as these two are mostly dependent on timeline. Broad coverage makes the efforts endless and that is not practical too. Understanding client's requirement and purpose to use the product can help in identifying coverage. With this, estimation about efforts should include proper buffer plus consideration of real time issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "#2. Communication:\n",
      "The art of communication is the language of leadership.  — James Humes\n",
      "\n",
      "Transparent communication is a key point for any project. Whether it's client communication, internal team communication, communication with management or communication with third party, it plays an important part in success of the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investing into communication improvements can be helpful forever, no matter at what level of project you are working. Communicating delays and conveying the concerns in right manner are the toughest jobs and good communication skills can help in achieving the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "#3. Skills and knowledge:\n",
      "You must know all there is to know in your particular field and keep on the alert for new knowledge. The least difference in knowledge between you and another man may spell his success and your failure.  — Henry Ford\n",
      "\n",
      "This is by default the most important part of any project. No matter how good you plan and how best tools are available, if you do not have required skills in the team, nothing can work. Updating oneself with current trends is very important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, single skill does not work for a lifetime. You have to adopt new things and you have to change or modify your skill set according to the current demands. Staying back with single domain knowledge and a number of years of experience does not matter in the current world, where everything is dynamic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "#4. Tools:\n",
      "Man is a tool-using animal. Without tools, he is nothing, with tools he is all.  — Thomas Carlyle\n",
      "\n",
      "Specific tools can make your project timeline achievable. Only manual efforts do not work in the fast world of today. Even if that is the only option, it should be supported with scripting knowledge, reporting tools, bug tracking, and project management tools. With this, automation tools are popping up like anything and having knowledge about specific tools and ability to select right tool as per requirements is expected at every level of testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "#5. Process:\n",
      "It's not what you do, but the way you do it.  — Anonymous\n",
      "\n",
      "Without following proper processes, the project can't succeed. As the project planning is an important factor to start, setting and following specific processes will help in completing the project successfully. No matter if you are following agile or waterfall methods, something should be there to measure and plan the efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "#6. Management:\n",
      "Project management can be defined as a way of developing structure in a complex project, where the independent variables of time, cost, resources and human behaviour come together.   — Rory Burke\n",
      "\n",
      "Project management is a job like walking on fire. Everyday challenges make it difficult to focus on long term goals. Also coordinating with team and client at the same time is definitely not an easy task. As a manager, your daily struggle to keep up with timelines, resource requirements, unavailability of required skills, pressure from the client, and many other things. Time and experience only can help in nurturing your management skills, although constant and conscious efforts are required for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "#7. Teamwork:\n",
      "Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships.  — Michael Jordan\n",
      "\n",
      "When working for a project, your personal ego has no importance. Teamwork can change anything and so the success of the project. Each and every team member is responsible for project success. Although it's management's responsibility to provide the healthy environment, personal attitude and positivity for the success of the project are also important.\n",
      "\n",
      "#8. Desire to give something extra:\n",
      "The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little extra.  —  Jimmy Johnson\n",
      "\n",
      "As most of the time, I have mentioned in my articles, everyone in the world wants something extra in response to the money they spend. A few efforts to provide something really useful or a little care to prevent some critical defects or help during non-working hours to overcome critical errors can certainly earn your client's respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Concluding the article with a famous quote:\n",
      "\n",
      "Every time you do a project, you learn something new.  — Justin Timberlake\n",

      "I was having a chat over coffee about Scrum and Agile with an Agile Coach who works for Australia's largest Bank at a local cafe. One of the topics we discussed was Agility and Scrum adoption in Asia. He is wondering whether there are any Asian Banks who are Agile from end-to-end — that is from the high-level management level down to the staff level. He wants to compare the level of maturity of Scrum adoption in these Asian Banks to the Bank he is currently working for. The Bank he is currently working for is opening several branches in South East Asian countries therefore, the management has asked him to fly to South East Asia to introduce Scrum and Agility to the local managers. However, he has faced resistance from the local managers. The local managers have asked him to find other Asian Banks that can be seen as a role model for Scrum adoption. Many Asian leaders believe that whatever that works in the Western world does not necessarily will work in the Eastern world.\n",
      "\n",
      "During his research, he found that most Banks in Asia has not gone full-throttle with Agility. He was quite surprised with his own findings because most large Banks in Australia see Agility as a necessity and not an option. He was also surprised that most Scrum adoption in Asia is only done at the software development level while the management is not using Agile management methods. Most (if not all) Asian companies are very conservative and has not gone fully on board with Agility. Most Asian companies who claims to be Agile only adopt Scrum for software development while at the management level, the managers are still using traditional management.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been conducting Scrum trainings and Scrum coachings for companies in Hong Kong, Dubai, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam over the past five years. I have seen many misunderstandings about Scrum and Agility from this part of the world. Managers who work in Asian companies perceive Scrum and Agility as a software development thing, they have not yet realised that in order for the company to reap benefits out of Agility, active participation and good understanding about Scrum and Agility from them is required. Over the years, I've also done mini-research and interviews with people about their local culture. The research is of course not very scientific because I want to get close and personal with these people when talking about their local culture. These local culture is preventing Scrum and Agility to be massively adopted in Asia and the reason why management is still resistant to adopt Agile management method.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few Asian companies who has gone full throttle with Agile, these companies are usually web companies who are lead by the younger generations who has worked or studied in Europe, Australia or North America. These leaders are a big believer in Scrum and Agility because they have seen it work at their previous workplace. Not only local Asian companies who are struggling to understand the real meaning of Agility, multinational companies who has development centres in Asia has not also reaped the most out of Scrum and Agility because the local managers are still using traditional approaches to manage the company and the Scrum teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ken Schwaber have written a blog post that people who are culturally attuned to predictability will actually see bad software, missed schedules, wasted money, and demoralized workers. Here are my additional reasons why Scrum and Agility do not work in Asia. I have put many generalisations in these reasonings. There are of course exceptions, although they are not many.\n",
      "\n",
      "1: Everything in life should have a hierarchy\n",
      "Asians believe that in order for the universe we live in to work systematically, everything should have a hierarchy. There is Yin and Yang. There is a Caste system. The younger generations should respect the older generations. Subordinates should listen to the Boss because most people believe that the Boss have all the answers. In some Asian countries where the King is an absolute monarch, the King should have all of the final answers. The same also goes in countries that adopts the single state party system.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Westerners believe in egalitarian, most Asian are comfortable in the presence of a hierarchy in which they know their position and the customs/rules for behavior in the situation. Having a freeform structure where everybody work collaboratively and cross-functionally in a self-organising manner is found to be illogical as it is seen to be an out-of-order system. People expect to be told what to do and people want to tell other people what to do because that is how a system that is in order works.\n",
      "\n",
      "In most Asian cultures, the position in the company also defines the social status in the society. Asian would rather be a Project Manager because the role is clear and because a PM has authority over many things compared to an Agile coach or a Scrum Master that does not have any authority to tell people what to do. For most people in Asia being a true Agile Coach or Scrum Master looks inferior. That is why when you browse over LinkedIn, you will often see people who claim to be a Scrum Master in their respective company will also put Project Manager as a side title because they want to get acknowledgement from their friends. The reason why many people in Asia who claim to be an Agile Coach or Scrum Master still put Project Manager title on their LinkedIn profile is either because their company has not yet recognized the role of Agile Coach or Scrum Master; or because they want to be seen to have power in the company and up-to-date with the latest trend in the Agile community at the same time. Even an Agile coach who does not have a Project Manager as a side title, still can't resist telling people what to do. Asians have not yet realised that Scrum Master is actually a Manager, a different kind of Manager.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides Scrum Master who still acts like a traditional top-down manager in many Asian companies, there is also no such thing as empowered \"Product Owner\" who I like to call as the Mini-CEO for the product she owns. Any decision made by a Product Owner can be (and most likely is going to be) overridden by anybody who has the strongest political power in the company. In Asian companies, most Product Owner is just like an accessory, he/she does not have any control over the product he/she is managing. But the funny thing is, these people who have stronger political power do not want to be a Product Owner as they are too \"busy\" collaborating with the development team. The word empowerment in many Asian companies mean, keeping away power from the inferiors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though these social strata is not seen to be important in the Western culture, it is seen to be very important in Asian culture. In most Asian companies, programmer is at the most bottom of the hierarchy. This position in the hierarchy most of the time defines the salary level too. That is also why the majority of Asian programmers do not dream to be a programmer for the rest of their life because programmer is at the lowest level in the company. And if they work as a programmer for the rest of their life the society will think their career is stagnant and not progressing. You will often see questions in Agile or Scrum community forum around career path as a Scrum Master or a developer in an organisation implementing Scrum 99% of the time are asked by Asian.\n",
      "\n",
      "From my observation the belief where everything in life should have a hierarchy is the major reason why Scrum does not work to the fullest in Asia.\n",
      "\n",
      "2: Let's keep things in harmony\n",
      "Asian are very good in keeping harmony. Asian tend to avoid conflicts in order to maintain harmony with their peers. There is nothing wrong with this but it is quite different to Westerners who aren't afraid to face conflict, confront directly, criticize, discuss controversial topics, press personal opinions about what they consider the truth. Having the courage to face conflict is encouraged in an Agile organisation but it is rarely seen in Asian companies, especially having a conflict with the Boss. Having conflict with the Boss will be seen as something that is rebellious.\n",
      "\n",
      "This habit of not getting used to face conflicts impact the way Agile teams in Asia run their Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospectives and Daily Scrum. And don't even mention about Pair Programming. People tend to hold back their opinions because they are not accustomed to a safe environment to make many mistakes. Retrospectives become dull and boring because people will say there is no problem at all during the Sprint when the reality is people are afraid to see problems that will be exposed if everyone speak up and after a while people will say their Retrospectives are useless and they should stop doing it. Sprint Planning becomes monotone where most people will just follow whoever have the loudest voice. Sprint Review just becomes a one-way demo and a project status update for the management. Sprint Planning just becomes a contract, no information exchange, no negotiation, no difference to the way it is done with Waterfall. Daily Scrum becomes a routinely held status update meeting for the managers instead of a daily collaborative plan adjustment.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the day, it is very hard to see transparency, one of the three legs in Scrum, from these kind of teams because people will do anything to tell you what you want to hear. People have fears to face conflict and get into trouble. It is also common that people will work longer hours without the Boss knowing to cover the issue that is currently happening. People don't question why Scrum becomes a micromanagement tool because people like to keep things in harmony and because people would like to secure their job because the management thinks that they are replaceable.\n",
      "\n",
      "3: Different education system, different school of thoughts\n",
      "Asian education system is very much different to the Western education system. Just as the Boss is seen to always have the answers, the same also applies in the classroom, the teacher and the lecturer is seen to be the smartest person in the room. While most schools in the West are moving towards active discussion using case method that involves everyone in the room, schools in Asia still emphasize on rote method. Such an approach will build strong test-takers, but it also puts huge pressure on students and discourages independent thinking. Asian education system is all about high grades and ranks, not about experimenting, self-discovery and making mistakes, which is what Agility is all about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having been taught in school and university where people are not encouraged to make lots of mistakes and encounter their own teachers and lecturers for almost sixteen years, Asian do not feel safe to make mistakes at the workplace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asian education system impacts the way people think and behave in the work environment. Self-organisation, the key tenets of Scrum is difficult to be done in Asian companies because self-organising is not what people have been taught in school and university. Asian have been taught to follow the rules and follow the system, breaking it would be seen as rebellious. Asian want to be told how to be Agile and how to do Scrum properly by the trainer or consultant rather than discovering the answers themselves. Educating Asian about self-organisation and self-discovery means undoing what people have been taught in school and university for almost sixteen years.\n",
      "\n",
      "4: Outsourcing — everything comes down to reducing costs\n",
      "The last reason why Scrum and Agility is found to be difficult to be done in Asian companies is because Asia is an outsourcing heaven. You may be questioning: Why is outsourcing even an issue?\n",
      "\n",
      "Companies in Europe, North America and Australia outsource to other countries in Asia to reduce cost. Unfortunately, this also comes with a cost. Just because these companies have seen Scrum and Agility work at their part of the world, it doesn't mean it is easy to implant the culture of Agility in Asia. Even though with Agility you can save development cost, it doesn't mean building the culture of Agility is also cheap. In fact Agility expects great team members and the best software developers most often are not cheap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of this cheapness mindset, I've seen it too many times where people take the cheapest route to be Agile: go to the cheapest training that teaches Scrum as a prescriptive solution, take online training, get the cheapest Agile certification, even pay for a test jockey to do their Scrum Master certification assessment, etc. Many Asians still think that Scrum is a project management methodology that can just be installed without any hard work and everything will be fixed the following day. This cheapness perception also comes from some (dodgy) Trainers and Consultants who taught them prescriptive Scrum and \"Agile Project Management\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Going to Scrum training and getting Scrum certification will not automatically make any organisation Agile. Moving into Agility involves hard work, patience, breaking the silos, putting aside pride, management involvement, trust, courage, many organisational changes, many experiments and many failures (that may involve experienced Agile Coaches) over many years. And all of that can be quite expensive. If building an Agile organisation is expensive, building an Agile organisation in Asia is even more expensive because of the two other reasons that I have mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrum does not work here in Asia as long as people still think that transitioning into Agility is cheap as chips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is that all? How can it be so hard?\n",
      "There are actually many other reasons why Scrum and Agility do not work here in Asia and why many Asian companies can not reap the most out of Scrum and Agility but some of my friends have advised me not to write it in a public space as many people will find it very sensitive and offensive. Even when writing this took me some courage as I expect some people will feel offended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will Scrum ever work in Asia? Can things change?\n",
      "Agility is still like an accessory in the majority of Asian companies, people don't really do it for the value behind it but for the sake of staying cool amongst the world. Asian companies don't want to look left behind in the Agile bandwagon, but instead of going full-throttle with Agility and making changes in their organisation, they sugarcoat whatever they are currently doing and call it Agile.\n",
      "\n",
      "I personally think it will take a revolution to have Scrum and Agility to be massively adopted by Asian companies and well understood by Asian leaders as there are many fundamental cultural barriers that need to be removed first to make Scrum fully works like in the Western companies, especially the hierarchical top-down management approach that is still very thick in the majority of Asian companies. But there is hope as many newer generations in Asia want to change how the organisation should be run in the 21st century. I am hoping that I am still around on the day where Scrum and Agility become the norm and no longer an option in Asia. I am hoping while continue sipping my last bit of coffee.\n",

      "Five Problem-Solving Skills\n",
      "1 -- Learn to split large complex goals into small, simpler ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Making coffee for four people as specified is the overall goal in this example. However, you can't just \"make coffee\" as if it was one single action. As anybody who knows how to make coffee could tell you, you need to divide the work into separate smaller tasks. Each of them needs to be simple enough to be easy to tackle at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a list of tasks that needs to be done to make the coffee as specified by the main goal:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The ability to split work into tasks is natural to humans, and a required skill to get most things done. Making the above list doesn't require any particular study or practice other than knowing how to make coffee. In other words, more or less anyone can do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the difference between a practical everyday problem like making coffee and a more complex challenge like software building is that the steps to build software are rarely heavily rehearsed. To be able to list what tasks are necessary to build a particular piece of software requires having done it many times before. That is not very common in software building. That's why experienced software engineers don't jump immediately to writing a task list. Instead, they split the overall problem into more straightforward ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Engineers refer to the problems to resolve as the \"what,\" and as the tasks to accomplish as the \"how.\" In the coffee making example, the list of subgoals (the what) could be crafted as follows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Subgoals:\n",
      "We have cups ready to be filled.\n",
      "We have enough ground coffee.\n",
      "The coffee maker is full of water.\n",
      "We have a filter filled with ground coffee. This subgoal requires subgoal #2 to be completed.\n",
      "The filter full of coffee is inside the coffee maker. This subgoal requires #4 to be completed.\n",
      "The coffee maker is brewing the coffee; requires #3 and #5 to be done.\n",
      "The coffee maker is done brewing; requires #6 to be done, and enough time to have passed.\n",
      "We have cups filled with coffee; requires #7 and #1 to be done.\n",
      "The cream was added to two of the cups; requires #1 to be completed.\n",
      "Sugar was added to one of the cups with the cream, and one of the cups without cream; requires #1 and #9 to be completed.\n",
      "The content of each cup is stirred and well mixed; requires #8, #9 and #10 to be completed.\n",
      "Note how these are not descriptions of tasks or actions. They are descriptions of results that need to be obtained and their dependencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "A graphical representation can be crafted to visualize the list above. Boxes represent subgoals, and incoming arrows into each box represent requirements to be satisfied for the subgoal to be achievable:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of coffee making it is tempting to just write a list of tasks. That works only for simple problems that you know how to resolve without much planning. However, in software building that is rarely the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Planning subgoals allows us to abstract results from actions, and that is a critical difference. For example, subgoal #4, \"we have a filter filled with ground coffee,\" might require going to the store to buy the filter. What matters in a subgoal is the result that needs to be achieved. The \"what\" is the important abstraction, while the \"how\" is a tactical choice that depends on the context (i.e., do you have filters or do you need to buy them?)\n",
      "\n",
      "2 -- Learn to think parallel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The subgoals presented above could be done one at the time, sequentially, in the order listed. However, that would not be optimal. The dependencies give us a clue on how what needs to be done in a specific order and what doesn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, you can start grinding the coffee beans first, and while the electric grinder is doing its job, you can fill the coffee maker with water. That's because filling the coffee maker with water doesn't require having the ground coffee ready. Also, grinding the coffee beans only requires to start the grinder, the rest of the time we'd be waiting for the grinder to finish. If the grinder were manual and kept you busy, that'd be a different story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, while you are waiting for the coffee maker to brew, you can get the cups out of the cabinet. In fact, nothing depends on the cups to be ready until we need to start pouring ingredients into them.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also pour the cream and the sugar in the empty cups, even before the coffee is done. Doing that has the effect of making stirring unnecessary; if you pour lots of hot coffee in cups already containing a little cream and sugar, the coffee ingredients mix naturally eliminating the need to stir. On the other hand, if you pour a little sugar or cream in a cup full of coffee, you need to stir to obtain a homogeneous mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reordering Tasks\n",
      "Reordering the tasks with the intent of maximizing parallel execution saves time and eliminates one of the steps. The final list of tasks, in the optimal order, is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Fill the electric grinder with coffee beans, and start it.\n",
      "While the grinder is doing its job, fill the coffee maker with water.\n",
      "When the grinder is done, put the ground coffee in the filter.\n",
      "Put the filter in the coffee maker.\n",
      "Start the coffee maker.\n",
      "While the coffee is brewing, get four cups out of the cabinet.\n",
      "Put cream in two coffee cups.\n",
      "Put sugar in one coffee cup without cream and in one with cream.\n",
      "Wait for the coffee to finish to brew.\n",
      "Pour coffee into each of the coffee cups.\n",
      "Or, represented as a sequence diagram (click on it to expand):\n",
      "\n",
      "[\n",
      "\n",
      "Note how the ordering of tasks doesn't affect the list of subgoals. It depends on it, and it's guided by it, but it doesn't change it. Tasks that are not dependent can be re-ordered in whatever way; that allows to maximize parallelism of execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, thinking about the subgoals first can be done without having to decide how to accomplish any of them. That further splits the overall problem into smaller ones that can be tackled in isolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3 -- Learn to abstract, but don't over-abstract.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of making coffee as specified is narrow and prescriptive. If the problem changes and you now have five people instead of 4, and somebody wants vanilla syrup in their coffee, and one person wants decaf, the list of subgoals and tasks would have to be re-designed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Programmers learn to design solutions so that they don't have to be re-designed every time that some of the parameters change. They learn to abstract problems in ways that allow a solution to resolve any class of problems similar to the original one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abstracting Coffee Making\n",
      "In the coffee example, you might want to abstract the subgoals to account for any number N of people, instead of a fixed 4. You might also want to introduce an abstraction for things like cream and sugar. You might call it \"extras.\" The list could change over time to include syrup, nutmeg, foam, eggnog, vodka or whatever people like to put in their coffee. Such abstraction could allow for any number X of extras that can be added in whatever amount in each of the cups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another abstraction could be the type of coffee. Caffeinated and decaf are two obvious ones, but there could be more, like a bold roast, medium roast, light roast, Colombian, breakfast blend, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the coffee maker can only brew a type of coffee at the time, you can see how this complicates things substantially. If some of the four people in the original problem asked for caffeinated and others asked for decaf, the requirement of serving the coffee to all of them at the same time and as hot as possible would get complicated to pull off. At that point, you need to abstract away the concept of how many coffee makers you have --- up to Y if you have Y coffee varieties. Also, the parallelism of the operations, if you have Y coffee makers independently running, can become tricky. At that point, a developer might want to consider abstracting the number of baristas. If you have K baristas working together, how does the whole thing change?\n",
      "\n",
      "Abstracting Some More\n",
      "At that point, you might realize that coffee is just another ingredient of a beverage, so why make it unique? You could decide that coffee is one of the extras, and eliminate the whole specialized idea of coffee. However, coffee requires special handling and preparation, so maybe all extras should allow for generic special handling and preparation. For example, if eggnog is one of the extras, there could be a whole flow to describe the making of eggnog. But, at that point, you could abstract preparation of anything, and eggnog would merely be another product that you can create.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over-Engineering\n",
      "Does your head hurt yet? Welcome inside the twisted world of over-engineering. Do you see how quickly abstractions complicate the picture if you push them too far? We started from one type of coffee, four people to be served, a fixed configuration of extras and one barista. That was easy and natural. If you try to abstract every aspect of making coffee and if you are contemplating the possibility of having N people to serve, X types of extras, Y coffee varieties, K baristas... now that gets complicated, especially if you want to optimize cost and speed of the operation. You quickly go from making coffee to making any product under the sun using any process possible. Ouch.\n",
      "\n",
      "An idealistic software engineer will try to abstract everything and will end up with a complicated machinery that is most likely planned to be used only to make coffee for a family of four people. An experienced software engineer, however, will abstract things to be able to resolve essential use cases and might consider other possible abstractions, but only to make sure that present decisions don't block future needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Balance\n",
      "When do you stop abstracting? That is an art that experience refines. The rule of thumb is that you should abstract only use cases that you think will be required shortly, and try not to block future abstractions with narrow decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4 -- Learn to Consider Re-Using Existing Solutions\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "No need to re-invent the wheel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not everything has to be re-invented from scratch. Experienced developers always consider using tools that are already available before they start designing a solution from scratch.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, instead of making coffee, can you go out and buy it from Starbucks and bring it to your four friends? If you don't have cups, coffee, and a coffee maker, going to Starbucks is a far cheaper and faster solution, especially if you don't plan to make coffee every day for a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding and re-using solutions that are ready to go is part of the problem-solving skills a developer needs to acquire.\n",
      "\n",
      "5 -- Learn to Think in Terms of Data Flows.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After years of practice, experienced developers start thinking of software, and problem-solving in terms of data flows through a system. In the coffee making problem, think of it as a flow of water, coffee, cups and extras from their sources all the way to the destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Water starts from the faucet; coffee comes from a bag that you have in your pantry --- the grocery store before that --- cups from your cupboard and the extras come from different sources depending what they are.\n",
      "\n",
      "These materials (data) flow through a series of steps that manipulate, transform and mix. The initial state is the raw resources located wherever they are stored, and the final state is a series of cups filled with coffee plus extras. The destination is somebody's mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thinking in terms of data flows allow to visualize the primary goal and its subgoals as a series of boxes and arrows. The boxes represent each action that affects the materials flowing in the system, and the arrows are like pipes where the materials flow through.\n",

The technology, even in its infancy, has disrupted different industries and sectors. Various features of Blockchain such as decentralization, immutability, and transparency make it appealing for business sectors and domains all across the world. One such industry that is leading the way in exploring the potential of blockchain is the banking and finance industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though there are several roadblocks in the way currently, it can be surely said that Blockchain holds the potential to transform the finance and banking sectors by reducing potential costs and labor savings. According to a PwC report, 24% of financial executives from all around the world are very familiar with blockchain technology, with North Americans significantly more familiar than those from other regions. Observing the wide-reaching implications of the technology, companies are constantly researching to find out the ways of applying blockchain in multiple sectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Talking specifically about the banking and finance sector, hundreds and thousands of funds are being regularly transferred from one region of the world to another within each day. This makes the global financial system one of the most popular sectors that could be benefited through the application of Blockchain. Operating on the basis of highly dependent manual networks, the banking and finance sector is prone to errors and frauds that could lead to a crippled money-management system. According to Global Fintech Report 2017, 77% of Fintech institutes expect to adopt blockchain as part of an in the production system or process by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blockchain for Banking Industry\n",
      "With the basic understanding of blockchain technology and its working, the real question that pops up into our minds is Blockchain really useful for the banking sector? If yes, then how can we utilize Blockchain in the best possible way for the industry? And most importantly, is blockchain here to stay or go?\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a claim by the Harvard Business Review, blockchain will do to banks what the internet did to media. When it comes to banks and financial organizations of this day, Blockchain has the potential to solve a lot of problems. Blockchain technology possesses all the attractive characteristics needed by a reliable technology involving money matters. It is safe, secure, decentralized, transparent as well as relatively cheaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blockchain provides a very high level of safety and security when it comes to exchanging data, information, and money. It also allows users to take advantage of the transparent network infrastructure along with low operational costs with the aid of decentralization. These characteristics make blockchain reliable, promising and in-demand solution for the banking and finance industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Financial institutes perform the necessary function of keeping money safe and secure for people and therefore, the processes in place require a lot of mediators. The involvement of these mediators is what makes the industry more expensive. Moreover, with the involvement of too many people and manual processes, the chances of errors and frauds always increase. Blockchain technology aims to do the heavy weightlifting by securing transactions and making the overall customer experience more satisfactory and less money consuming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of Some Banks Using Blockchain\n",
      "Though the word blockchain was treated sceptically by banks and financial institutions in the early days of its adoption, the story has changed now. With the success of Blockchain in various industries, the banking sector is actively seeking new areas and applications of the Blockchain technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Big names like JP Morgan Chase have dedicatedly placed their faith in the future of Blockchain technology. The American multinational investment bank headquartered in New York City has started a new division called the Quorum division specifically for research and implementation of Blockchain technology. Quorum is a distributed ledger and smart contract platform for enterprises that supports speedy transactions and throughput addressing challenges for the finance industry, banks and beyond. According to resources, they have already issued a yearly deposit certificate based on a distributed registry with a variable rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than these, a major US bank, Bank of America has filed a patent document which was published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The document talks about the implementation of a permissioned blockchain for securing records as well as authenticating business and personal data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The system would allow only authorised participants to access the data and keep a log of all the logging entries. Moreover, the proposed system will utilize blockchain technology to combine multiple existing data storage platforms into one. This secure single network will increase the overall efficiency and reduce the number of storage locations of the user’s data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another name in the line is Goldman Sachs, who is actively involved in research and support of the distributed registry technology. They have invested in a cryptocurrency project called Circle. The project is considered as one of the most well funded startups in the blockchain space. It aims to solve the key problem of volatility in the digital currency space thus, making the finance sector more reliable with crypto options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Backing such a popular project, Goldman Sachs group intends to become the leader in cryptocurrency adoption among their Wall Street competitors. They are also setting up their own cryptocurrency trading desk that will exclusively handle their digital trading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Applications of Blockchain in Finance\n",
      "With emerging use cases with each passing day, the blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt the banking and finance sector of current times. A few ways in which blockchain can change the current face of the banking industry are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Fraud Reduction\n",
      "The involvement of money in any situation leads to increased chances of fraudulent activities. And for an overall sector operating on the very base model of money, security is of utmost importance. More than 40% of financial bodies and intermediaries including money transfer service providers as well as stock exchanges are susceptible to heavy losses relating to economic crimes annually.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason being the usage of centralized database systems for operations and money management. A centralized database system is vulnerable and highly prone to cyber attacks as the single point of failure, such systems can be exploited by hackers. Once a hacker gets access to such a system, it is a child’s play for him/her to take the money. This leads to the need for more secure systems that are strong enough to avoid such attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enter Blockchain, a secure, non-corruptible technology operating on a distributed database system. Since blockchain is distributed, there is no chance of a single point of failure. Each transaction is stored in the form of a block with a cryptographic mechanism which is extremely difficult to corrupt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, all the blocks are linked to each other and due to this linking mechanism, if one block is breached all the other blocks on the blockchain immediately showcase the change. This, in turn, helps to track the breach and provides the hacker with no time to make changes in the overall system. With a secure Blockchain system in place, we can eliminate the cyber crimes and attacks of banking and financial sectors taking place in the current times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Know Your Customer (KYC)\n",
      "Banks and financial institutions are strictly concerned about the increasing costs that they have to bear in order to comply with AML and KYC i.e. Anti-money Laundering and Know Your Customer norms. All these processes consume a lot of time and have to be performed individually by all the banks and money based institutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a Thomson Reuters Survey, the overall estimated expenditure of these processes ranges from $60 million to $500 million yearly. These customers due diligence regulations are performed in order to reduce the money laundering as well as terrorist activities. Currently, banks need to upload the KYC data of a customer into a central registry which can be used for checking the information of an existing or new customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the adoption of a blockchain system, the independent verification of each client by one bank or financial organization would be accessible for other banks to use so that the KYC process doesn’t have to be restarted again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meaning that the duplication of efforts would be eliminated by the aid of blockchain technology. Moreover, all the updates of clients’ will be to all financial institutions in near real-time. This would result in the reduction of administrative efforts as well as costs for compliance departments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smart Assets\n",
      "Trade finance can become essentially challenging when transactions in the form of assets have to be recorded with a clear date and time stamp. Supply chains all around the world involve a lot many entities and components being bought and sold continuously. All paperwork involved in documenting the details of demand and supply is even more complicated. Blockchain can hold these records of smart assets in digitised form and get them updated in real-time. A smart asset system would not be limited to the entries of just objects moving from here to there but it can also have the track of where a particular item is delivered and where has it come from.\n",
      "\n",
      "A smart asset tracking system for the banks and financial institutes competing in the current times holds a lot of scope in the competition. A bank with a rich data set can turn this data into valuable information for its clients with the aid of blockchain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smart Contracts\n",
      "The application of smart contracts can prove particularly important in the banking and finance sector. A smart contract is a self-executable piece of code that runs when certain conditions written on it are completed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smart contracts, when used for financial transactions, would be helpful in increasing the speed and simplifying complex processes. This will also ensure the transfer of accurate information as the transaction will be approved only if all the written conditions of the code are met. Moreover, as these terms are visible to all the parties involved in the transactions, the chances of error at the time of execution are dropped drastically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trade Finance\n",
      "Trade finance is considered one of the most useful applications of blockchain technology in the banking sector. All the involved parties such as a complex transaction can be on-boarded on a blockchain network and the information can be shared by exporters, importers, and banks on one common distributed ledger. Once certain specified conditions of the deal are met, the smart contracts will automatically execute themselves and the respective parties can view all the actions performed.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to sources, an Israel-based start-up along with Barclays have successfully executed a trade transaction that would normally take 7 to 10 days in just 4 hours using Blockchain technology. When compared to the existing infrastructure, the use of blockchain can reduce costs dramatically relating to licensing, ticketing as well as other overhead charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why Blockchain for Banking?\n",
      "The current day banking systems are highly reliable on paper and outworn process. The Need of the hour is to have an upgraded system embedded with reliable and trust-able technology that could withstand frauds, scalability and security issues. The blockchain technology and its decentralized nature can give the banking systems the much-needed edge they’re on the lookout for.\n",
      "Banks cannot be termed as independently operating self-sufficient entities as any transactions made through them still involve intermediaries. Moreover, the rate through which money is transferred on an international scale can still take up to 5 days along with entailing risks. With a blockchain system in place, banks would be able to make transfers real quick without even having to take the burden of risks as the system would be self-sufficient to resolve it all on its own.\n",
      "The world is going digital and with this progress, even small transactions and payments are happening digitally. The economic activity rate is increasing and there’s no doubt in assuming that the rate will keep picking up in the coming days. The blockchain technology will make small transfers feasible and fast along with the aid of lower fee and scalability of transactions.\n",
      "Financial services other than banks are constantly evolving their systems with the aid of the latest technology in order to secure the markets by providing economically available services at cheaper rates. Banking and other financial institutions should look forward to the adoption of new blockchain technology too in order to secure their place in the ecosystem.\n",
      "Challenges in Adoption\n",
      "Blockchain sure has its advantages in terms of adoption given its proposed features but there are some hurdles along the road as well which need to be addressed for banks and financial institutions to grow ahead with blockchain.\n",
      "Interoperability:\n",
      "The blockchain technology is not bounded by any international rules and regulations that place a standard to it. With the increasing need for interoperability among large industries like banks, the technology needs to be compatible with different systems and should hold the potential to get adopted by the masses. The integration of existing systems with a blockchain based model is a big challenge today as the current systems and processes cannot be entirely eliminated. If the actual adoption of blockchain allows multiple systems to work together smoothly, operational feasibility can be achieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Privacy:\n",
      "Banks and financial institutions are the entities that are trusted by people for storing their funds. In order for blockchain to take their place, it is important to ensure that the data stored on the blockchain technology is kept securely and would not hamper the identity of any individual. As the transactions made on a public blockchain are publicly available, the need of exploring the potential of private blockchains for data-critical sectors is needed along with the resolution of issues like interoperability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Encryption:\n",
      "Private keys are the essential elements of a blockchain as they play a significant role in securing the data of an individual on the blockchain. However, a private key generated once has to be kept very securely as once it is misplaced or lost, there’s no way to get it back. Moreover, the encryption used to store data can be compromised by finding loopholes in the network which in turn, makes the blockchain susceptible to hacker attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Security:\n",
      "The blockchain network is secure and powerful as it is embedded with cryptography techniques. Cryptographic networks are complex to hack and thus, any kind of security breach in such networks would require a high amount of computational power in order to secure any hack. When a blockchain network is applied to any banking institution, it has to be secured with multiple security protocols. The network should be capable enough to restrict participating authorities to take control of the network only according to the access permission given to them. Depending upon the requirement, the blockchain involved in such systems or organisations could be permissioned or permissionless. People in an organisation need to be handled with different levels of access permissions in order to save the overall network from malicious insiders and cyber hackers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scalability:\n",
      "Growth of existing databases is undeniable. The number of entries will keep on increasing as the number of people will continue to grow too. This poses a big challenge to the application of blockchain technology network. The network created through a blockchain should be able to handle the growing traffic while maintaining the speed of accessibility for the network participants. If the blockchain technology is applied to the current banking systems and institutions, it has to ensure the capacity of handling large volumes of data too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Energy Consumption:\n",
      "Most of the current successfully running blockchain networks run on the concept of proof-of-work mechanism in which the network participants are rewarded based on how quickly they solve the equation to add a new block to the network. While this keeps the network working smoothly, it also increases the consumption of energy in enormous amounts in the form of computational work. This kind of computing power leaves massive carbon footprints which affect the environment. Before adopting Blockchain in an industry like banking, this issue needs to be resolved through alternate rewarding mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Legal Regulations:\n",
      "If blockchain is applied in the banking sector, the need for international and national regulations around it will become mandatory. Currently, cryptocurrencies, the most popular application of blockchain, do not have any regulations around them which makes them susceptible to both profits and losses. However, if and when blockchain finds its place in the banking or finance sector, the regulations need to be in place so as to avoid chaos among people in case of any losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Despite the strict jurisdictions around the banking sector, the financial institutions have started to realise the potential of blockchain technology seeing the popularity of cryptocurrencies in the current markets. The big giants in the banking sector have started conducting the tests for finding out the possible use cases of this decentralized technology for their business processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, some of the organizations are also investing heavily in such researches and tests conducted by startups to develop blockchain based solutions. With Blockchain entering the current scenario, a lot of problems could be solved while making the system more transparent, easy to access and reliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "During delivery of a product, there are times when I check the board and think \"Ok, all is in hand with the stories in play. Great, I can start to focus more to the left\". By 'left', I mean the Analysis area of the story wall, the right-hand side traditionally being Development and Done.\n",
      "\n",
      "This comes after I've gained the confidence that the devs understand what to build and that the automated test framework and stack is in a good shape. It takes time to reach this phase and relies on a lot of groundwork and discipline by the team in setting up pipelines, environments and workstations, and in me gaining confidence that the team is generally following all the good dev practices that TW believes in. Basically, a mature team.\n",
      " \n",
      "To me, this is a natural goal of the QA, to spend the majority of their time at the genesis of stories, learning about what the work is, the scope and how it fits with the product built to date. Being ahead of the development engine. I believe it is also an indicator of the team's practices and processes - dare I say it, the quality of the team?\n",
      " \n",
      "Imagine the other end of the spectrum, i.e. to the right-hand side of the story wall. The QA spends most of their time working on exploratory testing, finding defects and looking at automated tests. They'll obviously be involved in story kick-offs and have input in acceptance criteria, but the majority of their day is spent\n",

      " \n",
      "I believe there's a natural ebb and flow that occurs during projects where the QA finds themselves spending most time on one section of the wall. Multiple factors affect this (team size, maturity, external project influences, infrastructure etc), however I believe that if a QA can comfortably spend most time in the Analysis part of delivery, it's an indicator that the team is motoring along nicely and exercising good practices for software delivery.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "Software and web development can be really exciting, after years of work it can reward you a million dollars or you can get in a groove. Many of us only care about keeping a head above water. But isn't it our goal or did we dream about it in school and childhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "To earn more money, many of us search for additional work and don't bother about anything other than hands down programming. We can't take a rest, we can't spend more time with our family and friends, we can't do anything other than work. This leads to a stress and an unsatisfied life.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait. There is a way to make our life better. Really, a few time management principles can do our life successful and improve software and web development to profitable and fascinating levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Set your goals: long term and short term\n",
      "To make life better, first of all you need to know what is \"better\" for you. Where do you want to be next week, next quarter, next two years, or even next 20 years (if you are young enough Smile. You must decide for yourself what you want from your life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not plan in a lazy way\n",
      "Napoleon once told that only properly planned things can produce a desired result. Don't ignore this principle and invest time for planning. Remember, mussing is not planning. I like the classical citation: \"Sometimes I sit and think and sometimes I just sit\". Usually this phenomenon can eat much time. If you find yourself mussing, switch to another work, look out from the window or simply relax your eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regularly update your plans according to reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you can't plan, just track\n",
      "If you can't plan anything now, don't worry, you can do it later. Just track whatever you do on a paper, Excel sheet or use a task management software. Update the list every two hours, or at least in the end of the day on in the beginning. This will help you to find common interrupters and recurring tasks, this way you can plan things for future. Even one week of day to day time tracking can bring a light on how we live.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look at your time journal and try to find out things that don't really need to be done, things that could be done by someone else, work that can be done more effectively or quickly, actions that wastes others' time etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can download a simple time tracking template here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collect all tasks in a to do list\n",
      "Sometimes we have no work, and later we remember (or manager reminds) a number of important tasks, whose are very urgent and important. The only way to avoid such situations is to collect tasks in a to-do list. Add tasks to a list whenever it comes to you from your boss, colleague or from your mind. If you can't access computer, or don't remember the task, write it down on a scratch or any other media. Transfer it to the main list whenever possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Estimate every task, set deadlines yourself. This will help you to avoid doing things in a last minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adjust priorities\n",
      "Drucker Dictum told: \"Doing things right is not as important as doing the right things\". In software and web development it is possible to spend a lot of time for tasks that produce insufficient value for the customer or even do not produce any value at all. For example, writing a regular expression to split a coma-delimited array or writing a CORBA application to access two methods on a remote server. There is no silver bullet that can shoot all prioritization cases, but a few tips can help:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ask a customer or manager for the proper task ordering and prioritization first. Be sure to do it beforehand: not every customer can answer immediately.\n",
      "If someone else is dependent on a specific task then do it first.\n",
      "For equal tasks set priorities using a task difficulty: ugliest tasks first (some prefer interesting tasks first, why not?).\n",
      "Delegate when feasible\n",
      "If someone, who can take a part of your work, is available, do not hesitate to share some work with him. Give objectives, not procedures, take responsibility and accountability. Describe a task clearly. Provide a \"how to test\" example.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following rules can be used to determine whether to delegate a specific task or not:\n",
      "\n",
      "Will he/she do it better or faster than you? If yes, no doubt, delegate it.\n",
      "Will you commit a task to somebody if you have more important tasks to do? If yes, delegate it.\n",
      "Is someone is able to complete a work without your assistance, for example if you are out of office? If yes, delegate it.\n",
      "Of course, you can even delegate your work to your boss, but do not abuse.\n",
      "In a multi project environment, the work of the whole team cannot be distributed equally to every member. Someone will have to do more and someone less. Using Goldrat's Theory of Constraints, project cannot be completed until the slowest member completes his work. Thus delegation should be promoted inside a team, not only from manager to developer. This process can only be effective in teams with honest and open communication, like in XP and agile teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perfect is not better than good\n",
      "While writing a code, for example, it is more important to finish in time than to worry about a perfect solution that fits for all. Get the job done and you can add more features later. Do your best and \"Get it right the first time\". Do not save on coding conventions and code quality. Pure code usually increases support time later. Consider unit tests, it can improve quality and speedup development. Automated tests reward with a confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Split difficult tasks into bite-sized pieces\n",
      "People usually avoid difficult tasks. Break them down into smaller steps. Complete manageable chunks and soon you will notice that the problem is resolved. A very helpful approach is to add \"how to test\" notes for each task. This will setup a micro goal and will help in determining task completion. Of course, if these tests can be automated time on repeated tests will be reduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Identify your time wasters\n",
      "Man is a social creature, we deal with people every day and hour. We have colleagues, friends or kin. They can help or slowdown you in various ways. Someone can ask you directly, via phone, instant messaging or email. This leads to interruptions as well as time spending. Interruption of 6 - 9 minutes usually takes additional 4 - 5 minutes to recover. Five interruptions will shoot an hour. It's always good to think about ways to reduce a frequency of such interruptions. It is hard to setup firewall around or ignore others. For example, ignoring phone calls from sposure can lead to unpredictable results ;) The only way to reduce such time spending is to find repeatable time wasters. Once you get the whole picture it is easy to decide where to save and where to spend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plan relaxation and recreation\n",
      "Keith Frayn, professor of human metabolism at Oxford University, told TV Plus: \"Any normal person could survive for up to 60 days without food on just a water\". But without some sleep men can degrade much quickly. In 1964, a high school student Randy Gardner attempted to break the Guinness Book of World Records for the longest time awake - 260 hours. Stanley Coren describes the day-by-day impact on Randy in the book Sleep Thieves, as documented by John Ross of the US Navy Medical euro-psychiatric Research Unit in San Diego. Randy had trouble focusing his eyes on day 2, hallucinations on day 4, and slurred speech and short attention span by the last day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not expect high productivity if you are tired. Sleep recharges our brains and helps us to think more clearly. Plan your day adequately, do not save on sleeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Developers usually sit for 8 hours a day or more in the work place near a computer. This leads to emotional and physical diseases. One of our exposed organs is eyes. Working behind a monitor for a long time, even expensive one, will ruin our eyesight. To reduce pernicious influence on our eyes there are many techniques of eyes training. Type \"training eyes\" in a search engine and find a suitable training for you. Schedule it daily, just before a dinner, or at any other convenient time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not hesitate to ask friends or colleagues for an advice\n",
      "Almost every IT project involves risks; they are either hidden or visible in the beginning. Developers have to resolve them. Working on any of them, even a small risk, can take days or even weeks. To avoid these time spending just take the advice or help of your colleague or friend. I have many examples of how this rule reduced a time on difficult tasks and prevented project failures. An example from my experience: customers of our recent project required an extra safety for applications from possible cracks. One part of the protection was to download a component from the server and load this DLL to the application without writing to the disk. Even after two hours of research I couldn't find any useful information. I paused for a moment and tried to recall someone who could help me with it. I asked a friend of mine who has worked as a developer in another company and he helped me. He sent me a link to a tutorial that I was looking for and the problem was resolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reward yourself\n",
      "Everyone expects a reward or praise for his work, especially completion of something. Lack of a reward can kill our desire to work. This usually leads to a reduced productivity. That is why we prefer working for others than doing something for ourselves. Promise yourself a reward after completing a task or finishing a job. For example, let yourself to watch an interesting movie once you finish developing a page or a new feature or eat some sweets or anything.\n",

      "What is Alpha Testing ?\n",
      "Alpha testing is a type of acceptance testing; performed to identify all possible issues/bugs before releasing the product to everyday users or public.  The focus of this testing is to simulate real users by using blackbox and whitebox techniques. The aim is to carry out the tasks that a typical user might perform. Alpha testing is carried out in a lab environment and usually the testers are internal employees of the organization. To put it as simple as possible, this kind of testing is called alpha only because it is done early on, near the end of the development of the software, and before beta testing.\n",

Once you overcome that challenge, you get to move on to the next Level. The goal is to complete as many levels as possible.

      "Life is a big and complex game. It's the largest open world game known to date. We all begin with different starting stats and we're placed into a wide range of environments that can either give us advantages or disadvantages.\n",
      "\n",
      "But because most people have trouble conceptualizing Life, they therefore assume that they have no control over Life. But nothing could be further from the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Life's Cheat Codes - Robot Samurai \n",
      "\n",
      "Life's game design is actually surprisingly simple. It is guided by a few basic principles that are designed to give the player an experience of a large amount of randomness.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Life is designed to continually throw difficult and unexpected problems at you. Life is a never-ending stream of problems that must be confronted, surmounted, and/or solved. If at any point, Life runs out of problems to give us, then as players, we will unconsciously invent problems for ourselves. Problems are what keep us occupied and give our lives meaning and are, therefore, necessary to conquer Levels 4 and 5 (give value and leave a legacy).\n",
      "\n",
      "As players, we spend most of our time preparing ourselves for problems that are expected. But it is because of this preparation that, by definition, the most difficult problems we experience in Life will be unexpected.\n",
      "\n",
      "This steady barrage of unexpected problems gives the player a sense that she lacks control over her own Life, when in fact, the purpose of Life is not to control what happens to you, but rather control and choose higher level reactions to what happens to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Players may respond to problems with either Solutions or Distractions. All players must meet problems with a reaction (even choosing not to react to a problem, is itself, a reaction).\n",
      "\n",
      "All reactions can be divided up in two ways: Solutions and Distractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solutions are actions and pursuits that resolve a problem preventing it from continuing or happening again in the future. Distractions are actions or pursuits designed to either make the Player unaware of the problem's existence or to dull the pain the problem may be causing.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a Player feels they understand a problem and are capable of handling it, they will pursue a Solution. If players are just sick of Life's shit, then they will likely pursue Distractions to help them pretend the problem isn't actually there.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The more each Solution or Distraction is used, the easier and more automatic it will be in the future. The more often you use a Solution or Distraction, the easier it will be to use again, to the point where it will eventually become unconscious and automatic. Once a Solution or Distraction is unconscious and automatic, it becomes a Habit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Habits are necessary because they prevent you from falling back to previous Levels you've already conquered. A player, once they've found a Solution to a Level, must employ that Solution enough times to make it a Habit, thus mastering that level and allowing them to move on to the next Level.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Solutions move us towards the next Level, Distractions keep us on the same Level. Since gaining Levels in Life requires solving problems, distracting ourselves from our problems guarantees that we will become stuck on the same Level.\n",
      "\n",
      "If our Distractions become Habits, then we will become perpetually stuck at a level and not even be conscious of it. If you've ever wondered why all of your relationships have failed miserably in the past decade, then chances are your Distraction-Habits are preventing you from achieving the real intimacy necessary to beat Level 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The formula for winning at the game of Life is therefore actually incredibly simple:\n",
      "\n",
      "a) correctly identify your Solutions and Distractions\n",
      "b) eliminate the Distractions\n",
      "c) ????\n",
      "d) profit\n",
      "One simple example: There's a problem at work and my boss hates me, so I can either pursue a Solution (confront my boss, look to be transferred, work harder, etc.) or I can pursue a Distraction (party every night, smoke crack, masturbate while watching Disney cartoons, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "The more often I choose a Solution, the more it will make choosing subsequent Solutions easier, thus leading to an eventual Level Up. The more often I choose Distraction, the more it will make choosing subsequent Distractions easier, thus making me a deadbeat with a weird sex fetish.\n",
      "\n",
      "One final note before I teach you how to totally cheat life and get a giant pyramid built for you when you die:\n",
      "\n",
      "Just because you Level Up doesn't mean problems stop at previous levels. A bro's still gotta eat (Level 1). We all need to be safe to accomplish anything (Level 2). Relationships take work (Level 3), yadda, yadda.\n",
      "\n",
      "So think of Leveling Up as not necessarily going from juggling baseballs to juggling knives. Rather, Leveling Up is like going from juggling three knives to four, then five, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Below are the five cheat codes to help you navigate your way through Life and reach the end fully satisfied and Leveled-Up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Entering these cheat codes is easy: just press Tab at the View Screen to access your Mind's Eye. The Mind's Eye is where you actively observe yourself and choose what to think about. From there, just type in the cheats below at the \"Brain\" prompt and hit ENTER.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Note: These cheats, like Solutions and Distractions, also require repetition to work. So be patient with them. They will also eventually become their own Habits.)\n",
      "\n",
      "CHEAT #1: I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS\n",
      "Life's Cheat Codes - Take Responsibility\n",
      "\n",
      "The number one way people fuck up is by telling themselves that there's nothing they can do about the problems Life gives them.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can always do something about the problems Life gives you.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you decide that there's nothing you can do to solve a problem, you immediately limit your possible reactions to Distractions. And if you limit your responses to Distractions enough, pretty soon you will build a Life that is made up of nothing but Habits of Distractions. You'll be running away from everything, and everyone, all the time. And you'll probably turn into a grade-A selfish prick at that.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Another Note: \"selfishness\" is essentially a propensity for Distractions over Solutions. Since the people around you and your relationships benefit from Solutions and Distractions generally isolate you from others, constantly pursuing Distractions will likely make you into someone no one else wants to really hang around with – unless, that is, they pursue the same Distractions that you do. You know, two peas in a crack-pipe and all that.)\n",
      "\n",
      "This first \"cheat\" is so important, I once wrote an article about it called \"The Prime Belief\" and posted it on Facebook like three whole times. Some people even shared it and it wasn't just my Mom. Cheat #1 is so important, I dedicated an entire chapter in my book to it. It's so important that if you passed out drunk at a party, I'd write it on your forehead with a sharpie.\n",
      "\n",
      "CHEAT #2: WRITE THIS SHIT DOWN\n",
      "No, I'm not talking about writing down that you owe your buddy, Mike, $12 for those beers you drank. Although, that's probably worth noting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Separating Solutions from Distractions in your life is surprisingly difficult and complicated. This is because we have a tendency to lie to ourselves about our Distractions. We tell ourselves that we need our Distractions. We tell ourselves that our Distractions are just innocent fun. That we totally have them under control, and yeah, maybe I woke up under a bridge in my own vomit, but at least I remembered where I parked the car. See, I am responsible.\n",
      "\n",
      "But worst of all, sometimes we come to believe that our Distraction is actually a Solution. We think that spending 12 hours a day at the office will give us the loving family we want, that playing violin in the park for spare change is a career waiting to happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can often spend years (or decades) pursuing what we believe will level us up only to discover that we've basically been tweaking our nipples for the last 12 years, and while it felt good, we have nothing to show for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As such, we all need to develop an ability to observe our own thoughts. Psychologists sometimes call this \"metacognition.\" In the past, I've referred to it as meta-awesomeness. Here, I'm just going to call it \"not being a fuckface.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To observe your own thoughts and not be a fuckface, you need to get your thoughts out in front of you and pretend that they aren't yours. Only then can you hear how utterly ridiculous they sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "One common way to do this is to write down your thoughts regularly.\n",
      "\n",
      "This can be a journal, a blog (how do you think all this stuff started, anyway?), or even letters/emails to friends and family.\n",
      "\n",
      "The important part is that you are actively digging into the problems in your life and looking at your behavior from a third-person perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like, I know it sounds amazing when you decide to deal with your Mommy issues by popping pills and sleeping with a series of emotionally needy women just so you can take pleasure in telling them to fuck off later. That might feel like a good idea. But write it down. Then see what a fuckface you are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therapy also works in this regard. You go sit on a couch and say a bunch of things to this person who sits there and pretends to care. Then that person says your thoughts back to you, just in a different way. And then you're like, \"Oh wait, that sounds completely irrational. Thanks, Doc.\" And then you get screwed over because your health insurance doesn't cover it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if you're like the rest of the people in the US and are uninsured, you can accomplish almost as much by simply developing a habit of writing shit down.\n",
      "\n",
      "CHEAT #3: STOP FUCKING COMPLAINING\n",
      "Life's Cheat Codes - Stop Complaining\n",
      "\n",
      "Complaining literally accomplishes nothing. Plane late? Taxi ride bumpy? Favorite pizza restaurant ran out of pepperoncini?\n",
      "\n",
      "Take a deep breath… and then hold it in… forever, because you need to shut the fuck up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Complaining takes a problem and then prolongs it. It takes this experience that is anywhere from a nuisance to legit painful and then turns it into this social entity, and social entities suck because then we feel obligated to stand by them and defend them and make sure everybody understands them AND AGREES WITH US. And then you become that dude who is ADAMANT that this restaurant sucks, and will defend your opinion to the death, even when in truth, you really don't care that much, and you might even kind of like the place if you hadn't turned it into this big deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "People complain not because something sucks. People complain because they're looking for empathy and to feel connected with those around them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, complaining is maybe the least useful way to connect with other human beings. It's like working on your cardio by swimming through raw sewage. Yeah, you're getting a workout, but uhh, what's that thing growing on your face?\n",
      "\n",
      "CHEAT #4: STOP FANTASIZING\n",
      "Back when I was in college, I went on a Zen retreat, and I remember the zen master, during a Q&A session, suggested trying to stop daydreaming in our daily lives and to let go of fantasizing in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was like 20-years-old at the time, and thus, spent most of my waking hours fantasizing about either a) hot girls, b) rocking out on guitar in front of a bunch of hot girls, or c) throwing really cool parties that would be full of really hot girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Needless to say, the zen master's suggestion destroyed pretty much the only thoughts that gave me any semblance of happiness at the time. I resisted the notion the way a cat resists a bath.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then I got older, eventually got over the whole obsession-with-hot-girls thing that I think is a requirement for any man seeking even the appearance of maturity, and realized that Ms. Zen master (yes, it was a woman) was right all along.\n",
      "\n",
      "The human imagination is a powerful thing. And the imagination is a fun thing to play with – it's what attracts us to books and movies and TV shows that we binge-watch in a single weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when applied to ourselves, the imagination can become another form of Distraction. It can be a way of avoiding what is real and true for us in the moment, a way to live vicariously through the images and ideas fed to us by others. It's a way to feel a sense of accomplishment, all while sitting on our couch, alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most recurring fantasies we have about ourselves are reactions to our insecurities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Life's Cheat Codes - Stop Fantasizing\n",
      "I would count the number of insecurities going on in this picture, but if I did, I'd have to spend the rest of the article counting.\n",
      "I'll give you one guess what my one huge glaring insecurity was when I was 20-years-old… Yup, hot girls (or sex, or being attractive/desired/loved, or whatever you want to call it).\n",
      "\n",
      "And those fantasies didn't help me resolve that insecurity. On the contrary, my propensity to live in a fantasy-world (*cough* porn *cough*) obsessed with objectifying women and seeing them as sexual conquests pushed me into behavior and obsessions in my real life that were harder to relinquish than they needed to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you spend years fantasizing about that yacht, then chances are you'll be the guy who will wreck the rest of his life just to buy it. If you obsessively fantasize about being admired and loved by all, then you will fail to stand up for yourself in those many moments where you'll need to most.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fantasies are like any other Distraction – they are to be used sparingly and for nothing other than pure enjoyment. It's when they begin to sustain your sense of self-worth, your desire for importance in this world, that you will be hobbling yourself, and you will never Level Up again in Life.\n",
      "\n",
      "CHEAT #5: SHARE YOUR SHAME\n",
      "I'm about to sum up the biggest problem everyone deals with in the game of Life in one paragraph. Are you ready?\n",
      "\n",
      "When we're children, we are genuinely powerless to many of the problems in life. We therefore rely on our parents to help us find Solutions. But the more our parents fail to find Solutions, the more Distractions we must create for ourselves (notice how much children fantasize? That's not a coincidence) in order to cope with the difficulty of Life. The more Distractions we create for ourselves as children, and/or the more Distractions our parents teach us themselves, the more they will form into Habits that will continue into adulthood. Once adults, we will forget that our Distractions were merely reactions to problems, and we will come to believe that there is something inherently flawed or wrong about us and we must hide it from other people at all costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, we hide these things about ourselves, and to hide them, we must distract ourselves even further, and it just creates this downward spiral of Distraction and shame.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best way to get rid of our Distractions and to reclaim the problems that have been haunting us since childhood is to expose them, to share them, and recognize that a) no, you're not a freak, most people struggle(d) with the same problem, and b) that your Distractions are just that: unhealthy ways to compensate for how shitty you feel about yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's an old saying that \"sunlight is the best disinfectant.\" Well, that's true for ourselves as well. The only way to cure the darkest parts of yourself is to shine light on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good luck Player One. Remember, the game of Life is designed to be complex and confusing. The difficulty is not winning, but knowing what winning itself means. Because that's the real challenge: deciding what our own life is worth and then having the courage to go out and live it.\n",

Now, with a new initiative called Project Bloks, a team of Google researchers is trying to make coding a hands-on experience—literally.\n",

That way education researchers can spend less time figuring out the technical underpinning of electronic blocks or other gadgets and more time designing new, better ways for students to actually learn from the blocks.\n",

      "The project offers three different types of block. The \"pucks\" are the most interesting. Each puck can include a different type of control, such as an on/off switch or a directional arrow. According to a paper released by the Google team, pucks don't require any electronic components. You could even print them on paper using conductive ink. The pucks sit on a \"base board\" that shuttles data to a \"brain board,\" a kind of central control for your app. The brain board includes a power source and a cheap, tiny computer called the Raspberry Pi Zero, and it can communicate with other outside devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the musical instrument, these outside devices might include a speaker. In other cases, it might include a robot equipped with a pen for drawing lines on paper. Pucks could be associated with environmental sensors, such as a thermometer, and the program you assemble could simply send the current temperature to a computer. You can also save arrangements into a single puck, so you readily reuse them for another app or build more complex programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Importantly, each piece has features that help children understand how they fit together, such as matching magnetic strips or directional connectors. In Google's trials, which included 150 children, this design made it easier for kids to get started with the blocks without any instruction. Educators could then take these ideas as a starting point to develop new blocks based on this platform, and consider different lesson plans for working with the gadgets to deepen students understanding of the technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Project Bloks won't teach your kids enough about programming to land a job straight out of grade school. But that's not the point. The real idea is to give them a grounding in the basic concepts of computing. \"I think this project has the potential to change the discourse around [computer science] education,\" says Blikstein. \"Instead of focusing on the idea that CS is a job skill and that learning CS will land you a good job, we are focusing on CS as a new literacy for the 21st century, which is important for everyone regardless of your career path.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ideally, Project Bloks and other tangible computing systems should also educate people who otherwise would never consider learning to program. \"America and the planet very much need programming to become an 'I can do it too' activity\" says McNerney. \"Long gone should be the days when white, nerdy, boys rule the profession, and math-o-phobia steers smart girls away from engineering when they become teenagers.\"\n",

More recently, a plethora of new tangible computing platforms have arrived, such as LittleBits, Kibo and Osmo.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "“Sessions” are the idea that your user’s state is somehow preserved when he/she clicks from one page to the next. Remember, HTTP is stateless, so it’s up to either the browser or your application to “remember” what needs to be remembered.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this lesson you’ll learn about sessions, browser cookies, and how authentication is built in Rails. We’ll cover both home-grown authentication and the most commonly used authentication gem, Devise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Learning Outcomes\n",
      "Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment:\n",
      "\n",
      "What is a session?\n",
      "How is the session “hash” different from the cookies “hash”?\n",
      "What is the flash “hash” used for?\n",
      "When would you need to use flash.now instead of flash?\n",
      "What are controller filters and why are they useful?\n",
      "How do you run a controller filter for just a specific few actions?\n",
      "What’s the difference between authentication and authorization?\n",
      "Why is #has_secure_password a handy method?\n",
      "What is the basic overview of how to authenticate a user with that method?\n",
      "What additional steps (on a high level) are needed to actually “remember” a user after they’ve closed the browser?\n",
      "What is the Devise gem and why is it useful?\n",
      "Cookies, Sessions, and Flashes\n",
      "Cookies, Sessions and Flashes are three special objects that Rails gives you which each behave a lot like hashes. They are used to persist data between requests, whether until just the next request, until the browser is closed, or until a specified expiration has been reached. In addition to different temporal concerns, they each solve slightly different use cases, covered below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cookies\n",
      "Cookies are key-value data pairs that are stored in the user’s browser until they reach their specified expiration date. They can be used for pretty much anything, most commonly to “bookmark” the user’s place in a web page if she gets disconnected or to store simple site display preferences. You could also store shopping cart information or even passwords but that would be a bad idea – you shouldn’t store anything in regular browser cookies that needs to either be secure or persisted across browser sessions. It’s too easy for users to clear their cache and/or steal/manipulate unsecured cookies.\n",
      "\n",
      "To work with cookies, Rails gives you access to a special hash called cookies, where each key-value pair is stored as a separate cookie on the user’s browser. If you were to save cookies[:hair-color] = \"blonde\", you’d be able to pull up your browser’s developer tools and see a cookie on the user’s browser that has a key of hair-color and a value of blonde. Delete it using cookies.delete(:hair-color).\n",
      "\n",
      "With each new request to your server, the browser will send along all the cookies and you can access them in your controllers and views like a normal hash. You can also set their expiration dates, for example using syntax like cookies[:name] = { value: \"cookies YUM\", expires: Time.now + 3600}.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sessions\n",
      "Think about how websites keep track of how a user is logged in when the page reloads. HTTP requests are stateless so how can you tell that a given request actually came from that particular user who is logged in? This is why cookies are important – they allow you to keep track of your user from one request to another until the cookie expires.\n",
      "\n",
      "A special case is when you want to keep track of data in the user’s “session”, which represents all the stuff your user does while you’ve chosen to “remember” her, typically until the browser window is closed. In that case, every page she visits until the browser is closed will be part of the same session.\n",
      "\n",
      "To identify a user’s session information, Rails stores a special secure and tamper-proof cookie on the user’s browser that contains their entire session hash (look for it in your developer tools, usually under the “Resources” section) and it expires when the browser is closed. Whenever the user makes a request to your application, that request will also automatically include that session cookie (along with the other cookies) and you can use it to keep track of her logged-in state. This may all seem abstract now, but you’ll get a chance to see it in action shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rails gives you access to the session hash in an almost identical way to the above-mentioned cookies hash. Use the session variable in your views or controllers like so:\n",
      "\n",
      "  # app/controllers/users_controller.rb\n",
      "  ...\n",
      "  # Set a session value\n",
      "  session[:current_user_id] = user.id\n",
      "\n",
      "  # Access a session value\n",
      "  some_other_variable_value = session[:other_variable_key]\n",
      "\n",
      "  # Reset a session key\n",
      "  session[:key_to_be_reset] = nil\n",
      "\n",
      "  # Reset the entire session\n",
      "  reset_session\n",
      "  ...\n",
      "Why would you need both cookies and sessions? They are similar but not the same. session is an entire hash that gets put in the secure session cookie that expires when the user closes the browser. If you look in your developer tools, the “expiration” of that cookie is “session”. Each value in the cookies hash gets stored as an individual cookie.\n",
      "\n",
      "So cookies and sessions are sort of like temporary free database tables for you to use that are unique to a given user and will last until you either manually delete them, they have reached their expiration date, or the session is ended (depending on what you specified).\n",
      "\n",
      "A Few Additional Notes on Sessions and Cookies**\n",
      "session and cookies aren’t really hashes, Rails just pretends they are so it’s easy for you to work with them. You can still consider them as hashes just because they act very similarly to hashes.\n",
      "You are size-limited in terms of how much you can store inside a session hash or browser cookie (~4kb). It is sufficient for any “normal” usage, but don’t go pretending either of these are actually substitutes for a database.\n",
      "Flashes\n",
      "You’ve already seen and used the flash hash by now, but we’ll cover it again from the perspective of understanding sessions. flash is a special hash (okay, a method that acts like a hash) that persists only from one request to the next. You can think of it as a session hash that self destructs after it’s opened. It’s commonly used to send messages from the controller to the view so the user can see success and failure messages after submitting forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to pop up “Thanks for signing up!” on the user’s browser after running the #create action (which usually uses redirect_to to send the user to a totally new page when successful), how do you send that success message? You can’t use an instance variable because the redirect caused the browser to issue a brand new HTTP request and so all instance variables were lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flash is there to save the day! Just store flash[:success] (or whatever you’d like it called) and it will be available to your view on the next new request. As soon as the view accesses the hash, Rails erases the data so you don’t have it show up every time the user hits a new page. So clean, so convenient.\n",
      "\n",
      "What about cases where the user can’t sign up because of failed validations? In this case, the typical #create action would just render the #new action using the existing instance variables. Since it’s not a totally new request, you’ll want to have your error message available immediately. That’s why there’s the handy flash.now hash, e.g. flash.now[:error] = \"Fix your submission!\". Just like the regular flash, this one self destructs automatically after opening.\n",
      "\n",
      "You still have to write view code to display the flash messages. It’s common to write a short view helper that will pin any available flash message(s) to the top of the browser. You might also add a class to the message which will allow you to write some custom CSS, for instance turning :success messages green and :error messages red.\n",
      "\n",
      "  # app/views/layouts/application.html.erb\n",
      "  ...\n",
      "  <% flash.each do |name, message| %>\n",
      "    <div class=\"<%= name %>\"><%= message %></div>\n",
      "  <% end %>\n",
      "Controller Filters\n",
      "Before we talk about authentication, we need to cover controller filters. The idea of these filters is to run some code in your controller at very specific times, for instance before any other code has been run. That’s important because, if a user is requesting to run an action they haven’t been authorized for, you need to nip that request in the bud and send back the appropriate error/redirect before they’re able to do anything else. You’re basically “filtering out” unauthorized requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "We do this through the use of a “before filter”, which takes the name of the method we want to run:\n",
      "\n",
      "  # app/controllers/users_controller\n",
      "  before_action :require_login\n",
      "  ...\n",
      "  private\n",
      "\n",
      "  def require_login\n",
      "    # do stuff to check if user is logged in\n",
      "  end\n",
      "The before_action method takes the symbol of the method to run before anything else gets run in the controller. If it returns false or nil, the request will not succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can specify to only apply the filter for specific actions by specifying the only option, e.g. before_action :require_login, only: [:edit, :update]. The opposite applies by using the :except option… it will run for all actions except those specified.\n",
      "\n",
      "You’ll want to hide your filter methods behind the private designation so they can only be used by that controller.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, filters are inherited so if you’d like a filter to apply to absolutely every controller action, put it in your app/controllers/application_controller.rb file.\n",
      "\n",
      "Authentication\n",
      "The whole point of authentication is to make sure that the user is who they say they are. The standard way of managing this is through logging in your user via a sign in form. Once the user is logged in, you keep track of that user using the session until the user logs out.\n",
      "\n",
      "A related concept is authorization. Yes, you may be signed in, but are you actually authorized to access what you’re trying to access? The typical example is the difference between a regular user and an admin user. They both authenticate with the system but only the admin is authorized to make changes to certain things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Authentication and authorization go hand in hand – you first authenticate someone so you know who they are and can check if they’re authorized to view a page or perform an action. When you build your app, you’ll have a system of authentication to get the user signed in and to verify the user is who he says he is. You authorize the user to do certain things (like delete stuff) based on which methods are protected by controller filters that require signin or elevated permissions (e.g. admin status).\n",
      "\n",
      "Basic and Digest Authentication\n",
      "If you’re looking for a very casual and insecure way of authenticating people, HTTP Basic authentication can be used. We won’t cover the details here, but it basically involves submitting a username and password to a simple form and sending it (unencrypted) across the network. You use the #http_basic_authenticate_with method to do so (see the reading for examples) and to restrict access to certain controllers without it.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a slightly more secure (over HTTP) authentication system, use HTTP Digest Authentication. We’ll again not cover it here. It relies on a #before_action running a method which calls upon #authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest, which takes a block that should return the “correct” password that should have been provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem with both of these is that they hard code user names and passwords in your controller (or somewhere), so it’s really just a band-aid solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rolling Your Own Auth\n",
      "If you want user logins, you’ll need to go through a few extra steps. We won’t cover them explicitly here because you’ll get a chance to do them in the project. A few principles are useful to know going in, though. The following stuff may seem a bit abrupt and devoid of examples, but it’s really just a preview of what you’ll be doing shortly in the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we don’t store passwords in plain text in the database. That’s just asking for trouble (how many news stories have you seen about major sites getting hacked and passwords being exposed in plain text?). Instead, you’ll store an encrypted “password digest” version of the password.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a user submits their password via the login form, instead of comparing it directly with a plaintext version of that password, you actually convert the submitted password into digest form. You’ll then compare that new digest with the digest you’d previously stored from the user. If they match, you’ve got yourself a logged in user.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is much better because digests are one-way encryption. You can easily create a digest from a password string, but it’s extremely difficult to decrypt the digest and retrieve the original password. The most effective way to crack a bunch of digests is just to make a giant list of possible passwords, turn them into digests, and see if those digests match the one you’re trying to crack (i.e. guess-and-check on a massive scale).\n",
      "\n",
      "Rails doesn’t make you do everything yourself. It has a method called #has_secure_password which you just drop into your User model and it will add a lot of the functionality you’re looking for. To work with that handy method, you basically set up your User model to handle accepting password and password_confirmation attributes but you won’t actually persist those to the database. has_secure_password intercepts those values and converts them into the password digest for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "To initialize a new user session (when your user signs in), you’ll need to create a new controller (usually sessions_controller.rb) and the corresponding routes for :new, :create and :destroy. If the user passes the correct credentials (which we can check using the #authenticate method), you’ll use the session variable to store their ID, which you can use to validate that they are who they say they are. This is a simple way of authenticating the user that uses Rails’ existing session infrastructure, but only lasts as long as the session does.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your user wants to be “remembered” (you’ve probably seen the “remember me” checkbox plenty of times on login forms), you need a way to remember them for longer than just the length of the browser session. To do this, you’ll need to create another column in your Users table for an encrypted remember_token (or whatever you’d like to call it). You’ll use that to store a random string for that user that will be used in the future to identify him/her.\n",
      "\n",
      "You will drop the unencrypted token as a permanent cookie (using cookies.permanent[:remember_token]) into the user’s browser. That cookie will be submitted with each new request, so you can check with the encrypted version in the database to see who that user is whenever they make a request. This is basically a more explicit and permanent version of what Rails is doing with sessions. It’s best practice to reset the token on each new signin if the user signs out.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s usually good to make some helper methods for yourself to cover common behavior like signing in a user, checking if a user is signed in, and comparing the currently signed in user with another user (useful if the current user is looking at another user’s page and shouldn’t see links to “edit” it). These things will make your life much easier since you can reuse them in your controller filters or your views or even your tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "A generic step-by-step overview:\n",
      "\n",
      "Add a column to your Users table to contain the user’s password_digest.\n",
      "When the user signs up, turn the password they submitted into digest form and then store THAT in the new database column by adding the has_secure_password method to your User model.\n",
      "Don’t forget any necessary validations for password and password confirmation length.\n",
      "Build a sessions controller (and corresponding routes) and use the #authenticate method to sign in the user when the user has submitted the proper credentials using the signin form.\n",
      "Allow the user to be remembered by creating a remember_token column in the Users table and saving that token as a permanent cookie in the user’s browser. Reset on each new signin.\n",
      "On each page load that requires authentication (and using a #before_action in the appropriate controller(s)), first check the user’s cookie remember_token against the database to see if he’s already signed in. If not, redirect to the signin page.\n",
      "Make helper methods as necessary to let you do things like easily determine if a user is signed in or compare another user to the currently signed in user.\n",
      "Profit.\n",
      "Devise\n",
      "Devise is a gem which has been built to handle all this stuff for you. It may be tempting to immediately dive into it, but that’s not a good idea for beginners. It’s first of all quite important to understand the basic steps of authentication. Devise can also get fairly complex if you start running into problems or nonstandard use cases. It’s more useful for intermediate+ users of Rails than beginners.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, you’ll end up using it on most of your projects once you’ve mastered rolling your own authentication. It’s ultimately better than rolling your own auth because they’ve covered a lot of the edge cases and security loopholes that you might not think about. Devise lets you interface with more advanced authentication systems for talking to APIs like OAuth. So it’s quite useful down the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a short word, Devise prepackages for you a bunch of signin and signup forms and methods to help implement them. It’s made up of 10 modules (and you can choose which ones you want to use). You install the devise gem and run the installer to drop their files into your application. You’ll also need to run a database migration to add their additional fields to your Users table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Configuration will be dependent on your use case. Do you want to make the user confirm their signup using an email (the Confirmable module)? Do you want to allow the user to reset his password (the Recoverable module)?\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s beyond the scope of this lesson to teach Devise but you’ll certainly be using it by the end of the course. The trick is to read the documentation. They’ve got a fairly impressive set of docs available on Github. The point of showing it here is for you to see it, read it, and keep it in the back of your head until you actually use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assignment\n",
      "Read this article about how Rails sessions work.\n",
      "Watch this video to dive deep into sessions.\n",
      "Read Rails Guides on Controllers chapters 5-6. Don’t worry too much about the details of session_store configurations in 5.1 right now.\n",
      "Read Rails Guides on Controllers chapter 8 to understand controller filters.\n",
      "Read Rails guides on Controllers chapter 11 to understand more about authentication.\n",
      "Glance over the Devise Documentation. Read about how to install it in your Rails App and what the different modules do. You don’t need to use Devise just yet, so this is more of a reconnaissance mission for later.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Authentication can appear to be a fairly complicated topic – there are a lot of moving parts. At it’s core, though, you’re just checking whether the person making a request is actually a signed in user who has the permissions to do so, all by using browser cookies in some form or another.\n",
      "\n",
      "This lesson should have given you some appreciation for how complicated login systems can potentially get but it should also have removed the veil from the websites you’ve visited countless times. Auth isn’t rocket science and you’ll shortly be building it into your own applications.\n",

      "In May I attended my first software testing conference in person, StarEast in Orlando. I sat through most of the sessions, taking notes, which is in part why I was a bit caught off guard when the first speaker of the day said something that struck me the wrong way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker started with a brief company overview and then mentioned the firm's agile process. What I heard was: \"We utilize Scrum. And we document our process, and we repeat it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My first reaction was, \"Did I just hear what I think I heard?\" Ergo, they're \"agile\"? There was something in that implied statement that simply didn't compute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Waterfall development has been around since 1970. Waterfall follows a repeatable, incremental process. It's also heavily documented. None of that makes it agile. It doesn't make it adaptive.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's clear that some people still don't know what agile is all about. \"Agile\" has become the other \"A\" word (hint: automation). People talk about agile software development as the cure for everything, without knowing what it really means. We've strayed from the origins of the Agile Manifesto, and turned agile into something used and abused by salesmen to sell as a product, rather than as a mindset.\n",
      "\n",
      "People are so focused on being agile that they've forgotten the real objective: delivering quality to the customer. Here's how to keep the focus. \n",
      "My early agile experiences\n",
      "My first introduction to agile came in 2011. My team followed many of the standard agile processes: two-week sprints, daily standup meetings, backlog grooming, retro, and planning. I soon learned we were missing one key tenet: self-organizing teams. We had relocated to a brand-new building, where the office could have been set up and furnished in any fashion, but the decision was made to go with a standard cube farm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within a few months, management decided to tear down the cube farms in most areas, bringing down the walls between teams—and severely disrupting the development work going on—in favor of the open office concept. It did so without consulting anyone on our Scrum teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we got was agile-in-a-box. Management had only an idea of what agile was, and it brought in agile coaches who sold the company exactly what they thought it needed. \n",
      "\n",
      "In my next agile experience, I worked on a product team with multiple Scrum teams working on different areas of the same product. We had weekly releases, keeping each Scrum team on the same schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the ability for each team to deliver changes independently, we were not allowed to do so. What happened next was entirely predictable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The release cycle would begin at the start of each week, with a planned regression test cycle by each team prior to deploying to production. One team would discover a defect that would prevent every other team from being able to release their changes. This prevented us from releasing small changes more frequently, and instead forced us into larger releases with even more risk, one of the very things the agile process was intended to avoid.\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of agile\n",
      "So what is the purpose of agile? Agile doesn't mean no documentation, or no planning. Agile isn't about iteration. Iteration is a method, not a goal. We iterate in order to adapt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Agile is about being able to adapt to changing customer needs rapidly. It's about getting fast feedback from the customer, who is the ultimate arbiter of quality. Quality means different things to different people, but in this context I like the definition from Alan Page and Brent Jensen on the AB Testing podcast: Quality is a problem solved for the customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those involved with software development: You are not the customer. It's important to learn about the customer, to understand the customer, but you will never be the customer. This is why it is so important to deliver changes to the customer frequently, to get fast feedback, and know that you built the right thing, not simply built something that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a story my team worked on during my first introduction to agile that didn't go right. We discussed the story in our backlog grooming meeting, the developer wrote code to match the requirements, and I verified that the code worked without error. We demoed the story to our product owner, who immediately told us we'd built the wrong thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "We built the thing right—we verified code correctness—but we hadn't built the right thing. We didn't deliver the correct solution for the customer. Luckily, it was only a single story within our two-week sprint, and we were able to quickly adapt and make the necessary change.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pursuit of quality\n",
      "I watched a great session recently from the 2011 StarWest conference, presented by Dr. James Whittaker and titled \"All That Testing Is Getting in the Way of Quality.\" He talked a lot about testing, but his bigger lesson was: \"Don't waste your time doing stuff that doesn't matter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The customer doesn't care about: \n",
      "\n",
      "What process you follow\n",
      "Whether you sit in a cube farm or in an open office environment\n",
      "Whether your team is centrally located or whether some of the team is remote\n",
      "Whether you stand up for standup\n",
      "How many teams you have\n",
      "Your code and how you write it\n",
      "Your test plans or test cases\n",
      "Your bug reports\n",
      "Customers care about the software that is actually delivered. If it doesn't ship, it's of no value to the customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "StarEast was a reminder that buzzwords matter less than what development teams are trying to accomplish: finding ways to solve customer problems and deliver solutions faster. Forget about whether you're following agile, lean, XP, DevOps, BDD/TDD, or some combination of those things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, take this advice from Gen. George S. Patton:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you tell people where to go, but not how to get there, you'll be amazed by the results.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The best result for a customer is a problem solved. That's what quality really means. Focus on that.\n",

      "Phuơng pháp lập trình theo cặp được một số doanh nghiệp tin tuởng và áp dụng triệt để trong tất cả các dự án. Nhưng câu hỏi đặt ra đó là nó có ảnh hưởng như thế nào đến các lập trình viên và liệu rằng nó có thực sự hiệu quả và hữu ích? Trong bài viết này, hãy cùng tìm hiểu và phân tích những lợi ích cũng như những điểm trừ của phương pháp này trong trường hợp nó được sử dụng như là phương pháp phát triển phần mềm duy nhất trong một dự án.\n",
      "\n",
      "Định nghĩa\n",
      "Lập trình cặp là một phương pháp phát triển phần mềm linh hoạt trong đó có hai lập trình viên làm việc cùng với nhau trên cùng một máy tính. Người thực hiện công việc chủ động được gọi là “người lái” (driver) trong khi người còn lại sẽ làm “hoa tiêu” (navigator) hay “người quan sát” (observer). Vai trò của “người quan sát” là liên tục giám sát công việc của “người lái” để từ đó nhanh chóng xác định được các lỗi cú pháp, chính tả, v.v… “Người quan sát” cũng chịu trách nhiệm điều hành dự án đi đúng hướng. Hai người sẽ hoán đổi vai trò thường xuyên trong quá trình làm việc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Có thể có ba loại cặp đôi khi tạo các cặp lập trình, đó là: Người mới học việc - Người mới học việc (novice – novice), Người mới học việc – Chuyên gia (novice – expert), Chuyên gia - Chuyên gia (expert – expert). Cặp đôi giữa những lập trình viên còn thiếu kinh nghiệm (novice) giúp nâng cao hiệu suất công việc lên đáng kể so với khi họ làm việc một mình. Việc ghép cặp một người mới học việc (novice) với một lập trình viên giàu kinh nghiệm (expert) sẽ tạo ra một công cụ đào tạo tuyệt vời để từ đó giới thiệu và cho những lập trình viên non trẻ làm quen với một thứ ngôn ngữ mới hay một nền tảng mới. Cặp đôi chuyên gia – chuyên gia là một biến thể đầy nội lực và có thể tạo ra sự tăng vọt trong năng suất làm việc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tuy nhiên, theo như các nghiên cứu đã được thực hiện và cả kinh nghiệm thực tế của các kĩ sư phần mềm thì dù sử dụng kiểu ghép cặp nào, việc bắt cặp cũng sẽ chỉ là phương pháp giải quyết vấn đề tối ưu khi mà vấn đề đó là mới hoàn toàn, là chưa hề xảy ra trước đây. Điều này chỉ ra rằng việc áp dụng lập trình cặp toàn thời gian, liên tục có thể sẽ không phù hợp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lợi ích lập trình theo cặp mang lại\n",
      "1280px-Pair_Programming_at_Chitika.JPG\n",
      "\n",
      "Mục đích của việc lập trình theo cặp là để cải thiện chất lượng code và hiệu quả công việc đồng thời tạo điều kiện cho các lập trình viên học hỏi lẫn nhau.\n",
      "\n",
      "Qua nghiên cứu, người ta đã chỉ ra rằng kể cả hai lập trình viên mới học việc làm việc theo cặp cũng năng suất hơn một người làm việc một mình. Các kết quả nghiên cứu cũng cho thấy chất lượng code nâng cao rõ rệt khi áp dụng lập trình đôi, lượng lỗi có thể giảm thiểu được lên tới 15%. Việc những đoạn code mà “người lái” viết được “người quan sát” rà soát lại tức thì không chỉ giúp phát hiện ngay lập tức nhiều lỗi hơn mà còn hiệu quả hơn vì rõ ràng chỉnh sửa sao cho đúng từ đầu sẽ tốt hơn việc chỉ rà lại ở giai đoạn hoàn thiện.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hơn thế nữa, một trong những lợi ích lớn nhất của việc lập trình theo cặp đó là xây dựng tinh thần đồng đội, khuyến khích tinh thần giao tiếp và hợp tác. Việc lập trình phát triển phần mềm thường được miêu tả như một tác vụ thực hiện bởi chỉ một cá nhân và các kĩ sư phần mềm là những người rụt rè và trầm lặng. Thế nhưng, việc lập trình theo cặp khiến cho các lập trình viên phải làm việc với nhau một cách chủ động và kết quả là không chỉ từng cá nhân làm việc hiệu quả mà là những nhóm/cặp làm việc hiệu quả hơn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tuy vậy, một khía cạnh chưa được đề cập tới trong tất cả các nghiên cứu đó là dường như các nghiên cứu này chưa cân nhắc đến việc nếu việc lập trình theo cặp được áp dụng mọi lúc, hàng ngày, thì điều gì sẽ xảy ra. Mặc dù sự thật là các lập trình viên không hề dành cả ngày để code nhưng trong một số trường hợp, việc bắt cặp lại không phải là điều nên làm.\n",
      "\n",
      "100% sử dụng lập trình theo cặp: Nên hay Không nên?\n",
      "Dù rất nhiều nghiên cứu thực nghiệm đã chỉ ra rằng lập trình cặp là một trong những phương pháp phát triển phần mềm “thần kì” nhất, nhưng chúng ta vẫn còn những hoài nghi. Bởi vì có thể thấy rằng trong các nghiên cứu này các chuyên gia đã chưa đánh giá yếu tố “con người” một cách đúng đắn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trong các giai đoạn thực hiện của một dự án phần mềm, công việc không phải chỉ xoay quanh làm sao vượt qua các khó khăn, thách thức mà bên cạnh đó còn vô vàn các đoạn code nhỏ nhặt và nhàm chán nhưng vẫn cần phải làm vì chúng chiếm đa số trong các tác vụ cơ bản của các dự án này. Vấn đề ở đây đó là “người quan sát” sẽ phải ngồi nhìn hết những quá trình vặt vãnh và tẻ nhạt ấy mà không thể đóng góp hay làm gì có ích cả. Những kĩ năng của họ lẽ ra có thể được sử dụng vào việc thực hiện những phần code quan trọng hợn hay ít nhất cũng là làm thêm vài đoạn code nhàm chán chưa được thực hiện khác. Tóm lại, việc lập trình cặp toàn thời gian có thể gây ra việc lãng phí tài nguyên con người và thời gian, dẫn đến việc cả quá trình bị chậm lại bởi vì lẽ ra có những thời điểm “người quan sát” có thể thực hiện nhiều phần code khác, nhưng họ lại ngồi nhìn “người lái” ngao ngán. Lí luận này vẫn đúng kể cả khi các lập trình viên hoán đổi vai trò cho nhau.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ngoài ra, việc ghép cặp lập trình toàn thời gian cũng là một phương pháp tồi tệ đối với những lập trình viên đang học cách sử dụng các công cụ phát triển phần mềm. Việc ngồi quan sát “người lái” sử dụng các công cụ khác nhau hay quan sát họ tìm ra cách sử dụng công cụ cũng đều không hề có tác dụng học hỏi. Một vài tác vụ cần phải tự tay làm mới có thể hiểu được một cách toàn diện. Việc này có thể so sánh giống như một người sau khi xem vài trận bóng qua màn ảnh nhỏ không thể vỗ ngực tự tin mình có thể chơi bóng được.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thêm vào đó, “Bạn không muốn làm lãng phí thời gian của họ. Bạn không muốn tranh luận (trừ khi người kia cũng muốn tranh luận). Bạn từ bỏ thường xuyên hơn so với lúc bạn làm việc một mình” – Mark Wilden\n",
      "\n",
      "Lập trình theo cặp phụ thuộc vào khả năng hợp tác và làm việc hòa hợp giữa hai lập trình viên. Những nghiên cứu sau đây đều giả định rằng mọi người có thể luôn luôn hòa thuận với nhau. Điều này có thể xảy ra nếu đó là trong môi trường công việc và mọi người đều hành xử chuyên nghiệp. Khi đó, họ sẽ gạt cảm xúc qua một bên. Nhưng trên thực tế thì điều đó đơn giản chỉ có thể là không thể xảy ra. Điều này không phải là để ám chỉ họ có thể sẽ bực tức với nhau (họ có thể) nhưng họ có thể sẽ bất đồng, phản đối nhau rất nhiều khi cùng nhau quyết định một vấn đề nào đó. Việc này có thể sẽ khiến cho tiến độ thực hiện công việc giảm sút, và trong một vài trường hợp sẽ gây ra tâm lý hoài nghi chính bản thân mình cho các lập trình viên, họ sẽ nghĩ ý kiến quan điểm họ đưa ra là sai hay không đáng để được xem xét tới. Tâm lí này có phần lệch lạc và tệ hơn nó có thể sẽ gây ra sự căm ghét, hằn học. Nhưng hệ quả này hoàn toàn có thể ngăn chặn được bằng cách thực hiện lập trình cặp có chọn lọc, đúng lúc, đúng chỗ và chỉ bàn luận các vấn đề mang tính quyết định đối với dự án, còn lại sẽ để cho mỗi lập trình viên được tự do tùy nghi thực hiện.\n",
